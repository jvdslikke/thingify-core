Easy-to-use home automation software with containerized plugins.

# The idea

I found Home Assistant quite difficult to use. 

Also a new plugin was hard to get included because a pull request had to be accepted, while they have a lot of open pull requests. If plugins could run in containers, they can be secured so no need to have them reviewed. 

# Roadmap

1. Sensors
2. Storage
3. Authentication
4. Automation 
5. App store
